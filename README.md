# Ragtime_Panthera
A set of six axis gripper robotic arm based on DM actuator.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This project was collaboratively developed by **wEch1ng (芝士榴莲肥牛)** and myself.  

The **core structure design** and **most of the codebase** were independently completed by wEch1ng. My role during the project was mainly to provide **environment setup**, **technical guidance**, and to create **tutorials** based on the work he initiated.

In fact, the Panthera project itself was originally proposed by wEch1ng, who asked me to help produce tutorials so more people could follow along. The initial prototype, implementation, and project documentation were almost entirely developed by him. He has been extremely generous in sharing this complete robotic arm and gripper system with the community.
