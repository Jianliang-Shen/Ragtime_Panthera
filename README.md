# Ragtime_Panthera
A set of six axis gripper robotic arm based on DM actuator.

## Acknowledgements

This project was collaboratively developed by **wEch1ng (芝士榴莲肥牛)** and myself.  

The initial concept for the Panthera project was proposed by wEch1ng. During its development, I provided **technical guidance**, **environment setup**, **partial sponsorship**, and was heavily involved in **debugging and hardware verification**, contributing to roughly **40% ** of the overall workload.

Both of us built our own arm and worked through some iterations. In fact, the debugging phase was intense—we each sustained minor injuries 🤕 while assembling and tuning the robotic arm, so we sincerely remind everyone: **please prioritize safety** when working with mechanical systems.

The **core structure design**, **initial implementation**, and **main codebase** were led and mostly completed by wEch1ng. My role focused more on **repeated system testing**, **tutorial creation**, and **collaborative validation**. While it was a joint project in many respects, I believe **the primary credit still goes to wEch1ng**, who generously contributed this full-featured robotic arm and gripper system to the open-source community.
